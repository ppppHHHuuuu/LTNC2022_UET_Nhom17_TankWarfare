In reality, the traditional concept of the “object” is gone. Instead we have an Entity which is simply an ID. It doesn’t “contain” anything. Instead the ID is used as an index into an array of components. An array is contiguous in memory which lends itself well to being the data structure of choice. So the physics system might have a list of all entities that have a Transform, RigidBody, and Gravity component, and use the entity’s ID as an index into the Transform array, into the RigidBody array, and into the Gravity array.

So conceptually it’s all pretty simple. An Entity is an ID. A Component is a struct of data. A System is the logic that operates on the components. The meat of this post will be on how to implement those three elements in a way that is simple, easy to understand, and easy to use.
